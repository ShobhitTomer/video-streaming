This Video Streaming + Twitter Platform is a dynamic online platform combining features of YouTube and Twitter. Users can create accounts, upload their videos, stream videos from others, create playlists, like videos, and engage with the content through comments. The project leverages MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Cloudinary for the backend, while ReactJS powers the front end.

## Features

- **Playlists:** Create and manage playlists, adding favorite videos for easy access.
- **Like & Comment:** Engage with videos by liking them and adding comments to participate in discussions.
